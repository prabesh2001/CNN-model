# **Sea Animal Classification Using CNN**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of sea animals into 23 categories. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various sea creatures, including dolphins, sharks, crabs, and more. Through systematic experimentation with CNN configurations and hyperparameters, the model achieves accurate classification results.

## **Introduction**

Marine biodiversity monitoring is critical for ecological balance and environmental sustainability. Using CNNs, this project classifies sea animal images into their respective categories. The project also explores the impact of various hyperparameters and architectural adjustments to optimize model performance.

---

## **Dataset**

The dataset consists of images of sea animals grouped into the following 23 categories:
- Clams, Corals, Crabs, Dolphins, Eels, Fish, Jellyfish, Lobsters, Nudibranchs, Octopus, Otters, Penguins, Puffers, Sea Rays, Seahorses, Sea Urchins, Seals, Sharks, Shrimps, Squid, Starfish, Turtles/Tortoises, and Whales.

### **Preprocessing Steps**
- Resized images to 128x128 pixels.
- Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- Split dataset into 80% training and 20% validation.

---

## **Features**

- Implemented **Convolutional Layers** for feature extraction.
- Used **MaxPooling** and **AveragePooling** layers for dimensionality reduction.
- Added **Dropout layers** for regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Optimized using **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**.

---

## **Model Architecture**

The CNN architecture includes:
1. Convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (e.g., `[32, 64, 128]`).
2. Activation functions: ReLU, Swish, and Tanh.
3. Pooling layers: MaxPooling and AveragePooling.
4. Dropout layers for regularization.
5. Fully connected layers leading to a softmax output layer for 23 classes.

### **Best Configuration**:
- Filters: `[64, 128, 256]`
- Activation: `Tanh`
- Pooling: `MaxPooling`
- Dropout: 0.4
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: `0.001`
- Batch Size: `64`
- Epochs: `15`

## **Installation and Usage**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sea-animal-classification.git
cd sea-animal-classification
```

### **2. Install Required Packages**
Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Prepare the Dataset**
- Add the dataset folder (organized by class) in the project directory.
- Ensure images are correctly categorized into subfolders (e.g., `dataset/clams`, `dataset/sharks`).

### **4. Train the Model**
Run the training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### **5. Evaluate the Model**
Generate evaluation metrics and confusion matrix:
```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

## **Results**

- **Final Accuracy**: 84% on validation data.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes per-class performance.

*Snapshot Placeholder*: Add images for training/validation accuracy graph and confusion matrix here.

## **Future Work**

- Incorporate data augmentation to improve robustness.
- Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
- Extend the dataset to include additional marine species.
- Implement real-time sea animal detection using the trained model.
